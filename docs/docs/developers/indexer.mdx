# Indexer

Build your own GraphQL Indexer or use our existing GraphQL Indexer.

## What is GraphQL?

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is a query language and runtime for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need. Unlike traditional REST APIs, GraphQL provides a more efficient, powerful, and flexible approach to data fetching and manipulation. With GraphQL, you can:

- Request multiple resources in a single query
- Specify precisely the data you want to retrieve
- Receive predictable results that match your query structure
- Evolve your API without versioning
