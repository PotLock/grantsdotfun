# GRANTS.FUN Overview

Let's discover **GRANTS.FUN in less than 5 minutes**.

## Overview

GRANTS.FUN is an autonomous grant operator platform built on NEAR Protocol, designed to create and manage AI-powered grant distribution systems. It provides mechanisms for deploying AI agents that can autonomously evaluate and distribute grants based on social signals, particularly from Twitter/X.

### Key Features:

1. **AI Grant Operators**: Deploy autonomous agents that evaluate and distribute grants based on customizable criteria
2. **Social Integration**: Direct integration with Twitter/X for grant applications and community feedback
3. **Multi-reviewer System**: Set up multiple reviewers to evaluate grant effectiveness
4. **Token-based Governance**: Use GRANTS tokens for setting overall grant criteria and priorities
5. **On-chain Payments**: Automated grant distribution across multiple chains
6. **Built on Eliza**: Leveraging the Eliza Framework for robust AI agent capabilities

## Problem Statement

GRANTS.FUN addresses several key issues in the Web3 ecosystem:

1. **Grant Distribution Inefficiency**: Traditional grant programs are slow and resource-intensive
2. **Limited Social Integration**: Current systems lack direct integration with social platforms
3. **Centralized Decision Making**: Most grant programs rely on manual, centralized evaluation
4. **Scale Limitations**: Human-operated grant programs struggle to scale effectively

## Use Cases

- Autonomous grant distribution
- Social-signal based evaluation
- Community-driven funding allocation
- Cross-chain grant programs
- DAO treasury management
