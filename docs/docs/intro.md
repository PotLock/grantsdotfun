# 🎮 GRANTS.FUN Overview

Let's discover **GRANTS.FUN in less than 5 minutes** ⚡

## 🎯 Overview

GRANTS.FUN is an autonomous grant operator platform built on NEAR Protocol, designed to create and manage AI-powered grant distribution systems. It provides mechanisms for deploying AI agents that can autonomously evaluate and distribute grants based on social signals, particularly from Twitter/X.

### ✨ Key Features:

1. **🤖 AI Grant Operators**: Deploy autonomous agents that evaluate and distribute grants based on customizable criteria
2. **🐦 Social Integration**: Direct integration with Twitter/X for grant applications and community feedback
3. **👥 Multi-reviewer System**: Set up multiple reviewers to evaluate grant effectiveness based on the social media ID
4. **🏛️ Token-based Governance**: Use your GRant OPERATOR tokens for setting overall grant criteria and priorities (soon)
5. **💸 On-chain Payments**: Automated grant distribution across multiple chains

## 🤔 Problem Statement

GRANTS.FUN addresses several key issues in the Web3 ecosystem:

1. **⏳ Grant Distribution Inefficiency**: Traditional grant programs are slow and resource-intensive
2. **🔗 Limited Social Integration**: Current systems lack direct integration with social platforms
3. **👤 Centralized Decision Making**: Most grant programs rely on manual, centralized evaluation
4. **📈 Scale Limitations**: Human-operated grant programs struggle to scale effectively
